Choices are overwhelming, and every suburb comes with tradeoffs between location, price and desirability. While most people who buy in their hometown will have a good sense of what different neighbourhoods are like, what about someone who is new to a city and wants a better idea of what a good suburb to invest and/or live in?\n\nWith this in mind, the business problem we are trying to solve, is *\"Where should someone unfamiliar with Melbourne buy a house in metropolitan Melbourne?\"*. This question is relevant for large groups of people looking to purchase property in Melbourne. There are number of elements to this problem, reflecting the different criteria that people looking to purchase property should be considering, for example: \n- What are average property prices in different suburbs?\n- What amenities are available in different suburbs?\n- What are different suburbs \"like\" in terms of character? <br>  \n\nEach of these questions will be explored in this analysis",
